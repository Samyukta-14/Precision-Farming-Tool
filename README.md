# ðŸŒ± PrecisionFarm: Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System 

## Project Overview
PrecisionFarm is an intelligent agricultural decision support tool developed for a minor project at my university . The system provides data-driven recommendations for optimal crop selection and fertilizer application based on soil pH levels, climate conditions, and soil moisture content.

## Features
- **Soil Analysis Integration**: Processes soil pH measurements to determine suitable crops
- **Climate Compatibility Matching**: Analyzes local climate data to recommend appropriate crop varieties
- **Moisture-Based Recommendations**: Utilizes soil moisture data to optimize crop selection
- **Fertilizer Recommendation Engine**: Suggests optimal fertilizer types and application rates based on soil conditions
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple input system for soil and environmental parameters

## Technical Details
- Built using Pyhton 3.0
- Data-driven recommendation algorithms
- Soil chemistry models for pH-based crop compatibility
- Climate data integration for seasonal recommendations

## How to Use
1. Input soil pH level (acidic, neutral, alkaline)
2. Enter local climate data (temperature range, rainfall)
3. Specify current soil moisture level
4. View recommended crops suitable for your conditions
5. Receive customized fertilizer recommendations

## Future Improvements
- Integration with IoT soil sensors for real-time data
- Machine learning model to improve recommendations over time
- Mobile application for field-based recommendations
- Historical data tracking for crop rotation planning
